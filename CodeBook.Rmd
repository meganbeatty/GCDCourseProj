This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

featInstrument   | Feature: Measuring instrument (Accelerometer or Gyroscope)
featAcceleration | Feature: Acceleration signal (Body or Gravity)
featVariable     | Feature: Variable (Mean or SD)
featJerk         | Feature: Jerk signal
featMagnitude    | Feature: Magnitude of the signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
featAxis         | Feature: 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions (X, Y, or Z)
featCount        | Feature: Count of data points used to compute `average`
featAverage      | Feature: Average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Dataset structure
-----------------

```{r}
str(dtTidy)
```

List the key variables in the data table
----------------------------------------

```{r}
key(dtTidy)
```

Show a few rows of the dataset
------------------------------

```{r}
dtTidy
```

Summary of variables
--------------------

```{r}
summary(dtTidy)
```

List all possible combinations of features
------------------------------------------

```{r}
dtTidy[, .N, by=c(names(dtTidy)[grep("^feat", names(dtTidy))])]
```

Save to file
------------

Save data table objects to a file called `GCDCourseProjTidyData.txt`.

```{r save}
f <- file.path(path, "GCDCourseProjTidyData.txt")
write.table(dtTidy, f, quote=FALSE, sep="\t", row.names=FALSE)
```
